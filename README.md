# Odin Recipes 

This is my very first web project — a simple and clean **recipes website** built using only **basic HTML**. It’s part of my learning journey through The Odin Project and my first step into the world of web development.

##  Project Goals

- Understand the structure of an HTML document
- Practice using tags like `head`, `body`, `img`, `a`, `ul`, `ol`, and `div`
- Learn how to link multiple HTML pages together
- Build confidence in using Git and GitHub

##  What I Built

- A **main index page** that links to individual recipe pages
- Each recipe page includes:
  - A recipe name
  - An image
  - Description
  - Ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions

##  How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser — no installation or setup needed.


##  What I Learned

- Basic HTML syntax and tags
- Creating links and images
- Organizing files and folders for a project
- Writing useful Git commit messages
- Using GitHub to showcase my work

##  Future Improvements

- Add CSS for better styling
- Make the website responsive
- Add more recipes with categories

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to the butter-sugar mixture, mixing until just combined.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add Chocolate Chips: </strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to the butter-sugar mixture, mixing until just combined.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll the dough into balls, about 1.5 inches in diameter, and place them on the baking sheets, leaving space between them</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set and slightly golden. The centers may look underbaked but will firm up as they cool.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</p></li>

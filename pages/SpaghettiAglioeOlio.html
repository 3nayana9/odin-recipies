    <h1>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A classic Italian pasta dish from Naples, Spaghetti Aglio e Olio combines spaghetti with a simple sauce made from garlic, olive oil, and chili flakes. It's known for its bold flavors and quick preparation.​</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Cook the Spaghetti:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté gently, stirring frequently, until the garlic turns golden brown. Be careful not to burn it.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</strong> Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet. Toss to coat the pasta in the garlic-infused oil. If the mixture seems dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to achieve a silky consistency.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve immediately. </p></li>
